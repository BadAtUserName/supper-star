# Supper star

Was created with react as a portfolio project for Nucamp BootCamp.

The webiste is a collection of recipes from all over the internet. It is currently lacking some documentation and citation for the location of the original recipes. Given the limited amout of time available for this project I felt it was important to get the site working rather than making everythying super clean please stand by in the future for updates. If you find your recipe on this site, I am truly sorry and I am more than happy to give you credit or take it down. Please just send me a message I'm happy to adjust it.
